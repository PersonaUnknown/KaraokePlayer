[00:08.040] When the truth is found to be lies
[00:15.095] And all the joy within you dies
[00:18.519] Don't you want somebody to love
[00:22.208] Don't you need somebody to love
[00:25.735] Wouldn't you love somebody to love
[00:30.383] You better find somebody to love
[00:39.456] Love, love
[00:46.823] When the garden flowers, baby are dead, yes and
[00:53.696] Your mind, your mind is so full of red
[00:56.967] Don't you want somebody to love
[01:00.679] Don't you need somebody to love
[01:04.400] Wouldn't you love somebody to love
[01:08.871] You better find somebody to love
[01:14.609] Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his
[01:17.599] Yeah, but in your head, baby
[01:22.415] I'm afraid you don't know where it is
[01:25.560] Don't you want somebody to love
[01:29.327] Don't you need somebody to love
[01:32.911] Wouldn't you love somebody to love
[01:47.279] You better find somebody to love
[01:51.367] Tears are running down
[01:54.295] They're all running down your breast
[01:56.535] And your friends, baby
[02:00.776] They treat you like a guest
[02:04.231] Don't you want somebody to love
[02:07.983] Don't you need somebody to love
[02:11.599] Wouldn't you love somebody to love
[02:12.188] You better find somebody to love
[02:24:000] (The End)
